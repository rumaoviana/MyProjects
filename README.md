# Video Library System in Java
The system can be used to facilitate the borrowing and the management of the videos the library keeps.
The system is mainly menu-driven with the main menu options as follows:
 1.Add new video to the system   
 2.Borrow video
 3.Modify video record
 4.Delete video record
 5.Search video
 6.Report of available videos
 Exit
Implemented the concept of File. The advantage of using file is that the data does not get deleted unless we delete the file itself, if we would have used  linked list or array then after closing the program if we did open it again then we have to enter all the data again.
Implemented the concept of reader and writer function.
